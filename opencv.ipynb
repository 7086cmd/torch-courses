    "The OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel). The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license.\n",

    "- Video capture and processing;\n",

    "- Image transformations, including scaling, rotating, and flipping;\n",
