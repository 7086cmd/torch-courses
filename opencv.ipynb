    "The OpenCV is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez (which was later acquired by Intel). The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV supports the deep learning frameworks TensorFlow, Torch/PyTorch, and Caffe.\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenCV is written in C++ and its primary interface is in C++. It has a C interface, and it also has interfaces for Python, Java, and MATLAB/Octave.\n",

    "In this course, we will get started with OpenCV including these parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic concepts, including the BGR color space, image channels, and image types;\n",
    "- Reading, displaying, and saving images;\n",
    "- Video capture and processing;\n",
    "- Drawing shapes and text on images;\n",
    "- Image transformations, including scaling, rotating, and flipping;\n",
    "- Image arithmetic, including addition, subtraction, and bitwise operations;\n",
    "- Image thresholding;\n",
    "- etc.\n",
